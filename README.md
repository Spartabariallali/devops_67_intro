### What is DevOps?
-  Devops is a term referring to a change in culture change in Operations and Development. It is often associated with continuous integration and continous delivery.
- These are software engineering practices, but also infrastructure as code, which consists of codifying the structure and configuration of infrastructure. 
- the term advocates bringing together both operations and development together within teams. 
- definition of DevOps: " The union of people, process and products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users"
### Why DevOps? 
- DevOps culture is also the extension of agile processes (scrum, XP, and so on), which make it possible to reduce delivery times and already involve developers and business teams, but are often hindered because of the non-inclusion of Ops in the same teams.

### Challenges of Devops?
- * There are multiple challenges of devops but here are are few:
* Switching from Legacy Infrastructure to Microservices: In order to reduce stability issues, organisations now use infrastructure as code along with microservices for quicker development along with sharp innovations. Moreover, organisations need to update their hardware and software systems according to the latest trends on a regular basis, so that new systems can co-exist with the existing systems.
* Test Automation: Test Automation holds equal importance as CI/CD deployments. It has been commonly observed that companies tend to neglect test automation and focus more on CI/CD deployments. For DevOps to be a success, continuous testing acts as a key. 
* Change in Culture: The workplace culture undergoes the major amount of transformation while implementing DevOps. It is also one of the most difficult areas of transformation as it is a long term process which also requires a lot of patience and endurance. To make the process a bit easier, enterprises should try and maintain a positive as well as a transparent atmosphere in the workplace.


### Benefits of Devops 
- The communication and this link between Dev and Ops does, therefore, allow a better follow-up of end-to-end production deployments and more frequent deployments of a better quality, saving money for the company.
To facilitate this collaboration and improve communication between Dev and Ops, there are several key elements in the processes to be put in place, as in the following examples:
-More frequent application deployments with integration and continuous delivery (called CI/CD)
The implementation and automation of unitary and integration tests, with a process focused on Behavior-Driven Design (BDD) or Test-Driven Design (TDD)
The implementation of a means of collecting feedback from users Monitoring applications and infrastructure
